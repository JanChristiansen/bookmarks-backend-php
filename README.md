This is the backend of my personal bookmark management tool.
It's just a Symfony playing ground with a real usecase (at least for me).
Maybe it works.. Maybe not.

Take it as it is.


## Installation
1. Clone repository
2. `composer install`
3. Adjust app/config/parameters.yml to your needs
4. `bin/console app:user:create` to create your user with his root category
5. Profit?
